1)initially data collect garchu from various users (first.py ) vanne program le . (first phase ma only a-z)
2)create a ui/videointake garne platform (opencv ko videointake)
3)video intake garera as first.py, continuously data read garcha and the data is continuously fed to the model
4)if any data matches/pattern matches from the dataset , tala ya kunai thau ma tesko outout aaucha 
5)else no data output 

####-model le k garcha 
-> given A-Z dataset ma train garcha for the labels A-z
-> a-z recognize garna sakne able banaune by training and all
-> continuously fetches the data, and gives out live output
-> if in data range, gives out value , else null/nothing 

### kaam kasari garne 
-> initially model banauney 
->rough patch ma dynamically image provide garera check garne 
-> better accuracy aauna thale pachi cv2 ma apply garne 
->ui/output ko lagi last ma as per the need
